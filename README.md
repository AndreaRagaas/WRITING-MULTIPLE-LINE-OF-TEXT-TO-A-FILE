# Multiple Line Text Writer

This Python code provides a method to write multiple lines of text content into a text file named `mylife.txt`. The code prompts the user to enter lines of text and appends them to the file, allowing the user to continue adding more lines or exit when desired.

## Code Explanation

1. First, a file named `mylife.txt` is created using the `open()` function in write mode (`"w"`).

2. The user is prompted to enter a line of text using the `input()` function within a `while` loop. The loop continues until the user enters a non-empty line.

3. After the user enters a line of text, it is written to the file using the `write()` method. The line is appended with a newline character `'\n'` to separate each line.

4. Following that, the user is asked if they want to add more lines. This is done using another nested `while` loop.

5. If the user chooses to add more lines (`choice == 'y'`), they are prompted again to enter a line of text. The line is written to the file if it is not empty.

6. If the user chooses not to add more lines (`choice == 'n'`), the program exits.

7. If the user enters an invalid choice, the program continues to prompt for a valid choice.

8. Once the user finishes adding lines and chooses to exit, the outer `while` loop is terminated using `exit()`.

9. Finally, the file is closed using the `close()` method to release system resources.

## Usage

1. Save the code in a Python file with a `.py` extension, e.g., `text_writer.py`.

2. Run the Python script.

3. Enter lines of text when prompted.

4. To add more lines, enter `'y'` when asked. If you're finished, enter `'n'`.

5. The lines of text will be written to the file `mylife.txt` in the same directory as the Python script.

**Note:** If the file `mylife.txt` already exists, its contents will be overwritten.

Feel free to modify the code according to your needs, such as changing the file name or file mode.
